## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project predicts e-commerce delivery times for Amazon orders using Machine Learning. By analyzing factors like product category, distance, traffic, weather, and agent performance, the system estimates delivery duration. A Streamlit web app allows users to input order details and get real-time delivery predictions. Model experiments and metrics are tracked with MLflow.

## ðŸŽ¯ Outcomes
- Cleaned and preprocessed raw dataset with missing values, duplicates, and categorical variables handled.
- Engineered features such as geospatial distance, time-based variables, and agent performance metrics.
- Developed and compared regression models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Evaluated models with RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².
- Best-performing model deployed via a Streamlit interface for interactive predictions.
- MLflow used for experiment tracking, hyperparameter tuning, and version management.
